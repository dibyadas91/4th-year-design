 First, it is an inverse square law, meaning that the strength of the force between two massive objects decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between them as they move farther apart. In a sense, the idea of inertia is unnecessary; it just gives a name to the concept Newton describes in his First Law. Kepler's First Law states that the path of the planet is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. Newtons First Law states that the object will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.Also included in Newtons First Law, though not explicitly, is the concept of inertia.
