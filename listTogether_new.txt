 first it is an inverse square law meaning that the strength of the force between two massive objects decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between them as they move farther apart. in a sense the idea of inertia is unnecessary it just gives a name to the concept newton describes in his first law. keplers first law states that the path of the planet is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. newtons first law states that the object will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.also included in newtons first law though not explicitly is the concept of inertia.
